## convert csv to json

The given Python code is a script that converts data from a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file to a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file. It defines a function `csv_to_json` that takes two file paths as input parameters: `csvFilePath` for the CSV file and `jsonFilePath` for the JSON file. It reads the data from the CSV file, converts it to a list of dictionaries, and then writes the data as a JSON object to the specified JSON file.

**Let's break down the code step by step:**

The script imports the required modules `csv` and `json`.

The `csv_to_json` function is defined, which takes two parameters: csvFilePath (path to the CSV file) and `jsonFilePath` (path to the JSON file).

Inside the function, a list called data is initialized. This list will store dictionaries representing each row of data from the CSV file.

The script opens the CSV file using the open function in a with statement. It specifies `encoding='utf-8-sig'` to handle UTF-8 encoded CSV files, including those with a byte order mark (BOM). The with statement ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite (indented block of code) finishes execution.

The `csv.DictReader` class is used to read the CSV file. `csv.DictReader` treats the first row of the CSV file as the header and each subsequent row as a dictionary, where the keys are the header field names, and the values are the corresponding values from the row.

A loop is used to iterate over each row of the CSV file using the `csvReader`.

Inside the loop, each row (represented as a dictionary) is appended to the data list.

After reading all rows from the CSV file, the CSV file is automatically closed due to the with statement.

The script then opens the JSON file for writing using the open function with mode 'w' (write mode). Again, a with statement is used to ensure proper file handling.

The json.dumps function is used to convert the data list (which contains dictionaries) into a JSON-formatted string. The `indent=4` parameter is used to format the JSON output with an indentation level of 4 spaces, making the JSON file more human-readable.

The JSON-formatted data is written to the JSON file using the write method of the file object.

Finally, the function ends, and the script calls the `csv_to_json` function with the file paths of the CSV and JSON files to perform the conversion.

The paths for the CSV and JSON files are specified using raw string literals (prefixed with r). Raw string literals treat backslashes as literal characters, which is useful for file paths on various platforms.

### execute the conversion
To use this script, you need to have a CSV file (`data.csv`) with comma-separated values and run the script with Python. The script will read the data from the CSV file, convert it to JSON format, and write it to a new JSON file (`data.json`) in the same directory. The resulting JSON file will contain an array of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row from the original CSV file, with keys corresponding to the column headers and values corresponding to the data in each row.
